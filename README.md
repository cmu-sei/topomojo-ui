# Topomojo Ui Apps

## Dev

A one time fix-up is necessary for a couple of packages before building.

```bash
bash tools/fixup-wmks.sh
bash tools/fixup-monaco-esm.sh
```

(Or after a new package version is installed.)

## Documentation

TopoMojo is part of the [Crucible](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/) framework. We maintain comprehensive documentation for all Crucible apps, including Topomojo, there. [Check it out!](https://cmu-sei.github.io/crucible/topomojo)

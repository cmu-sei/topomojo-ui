    Upload ISO files (or regular files) to include in your lab. Uploaded files can be selected as ISOs and attached to
    VMs in the Templates tab or attached dynamically per-variant in the Challenge tab. If your upload isn't already an
    ISO, TopoMojo wraps it into an ISO after upload.

    Tip: With the Local filter enabled, you'll only see ISOs available to this workspace. Disabling it shows global ISOs
